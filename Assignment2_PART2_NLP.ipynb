    "### 2.1 Fast Text [3 pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "FastText[1] is a neural network based text classification model designed to be computationally efficient. Your task is to implement the FastText algorithm by completeing the code in the following cells. You will need to read through the provided fastText.pdf paper, which explains the algorithm. You do not need to implement Hierarchical softmax (2.1) or N-gram features (2.2), you only need to implement the basic architecture described in (2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The FastText model will be trained using mini-batch gradient descent. When the training data are sequences of variable lengths we can not simply stack multiple training sequences into one tensor. Instead, it is common to assume that there is a maximal sequence length, so that all sequences in a batch are fitted into tensors of the same dimensions. For sequences shorter than the maximal length, we append them with a special pad word so that all sequences in a batch are of the same length. A *pad word* is a special token, whose embedding is an all-zero vector, so that the presence of pad words does not change the output of the model. In this code, the pad word has an ID of 0, when implementing your embeddings you should ensure that this ID is always embedded to a vector of all zeros. Additionally, you will need to know how many words are in each input sentence (before they got padded to be the same length), this is provided as an input parameter to your FastText model.\n",
